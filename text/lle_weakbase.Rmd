If the solute is a weak base, B, then we have to consider both its equilibrium partition constant, $K_D$, and its base dissociation constant, $K_b$, to determine its distribution ratio, $D$. 

**Exercise 1**. Beginning with the equations for $K_D$, $D$, and $K_b$
$$K_D = \frac{[\ce{B}_{org}]}{[\ce{B}_{aq}]} \quad \quad D = \frac{[\ce{B}_{org}]}{[\ce{B}_{aq}]+[\ce{HB+}_{aq}]} \quad \quad  K_b = \frac{[\ce{OH-}][\ce{HB+}_{aq}]}{[\ce{B}_{aq}]}$$
show that
$$D = \frac{K_D[\ce{OH-}]}{[\ce{OH-}] + K_b}$$

**Exercise 2.** Note that $D$ is a function of $[\text{OH}^-]$, which means $(Q_{aq})_n$ varies with the pH of the aqueous phase. Set the upper set of sliders to $\log(D) = 0$, $V_{aq} = 25 \text{ mL}$, $V_{org} = 25 \text{ mL}$, and $n = 1$ extractions. Adjust the solute's p$K_b$ to 5.00 and explore how the aqueous layer's pH affects the extraction of B from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Given the equation for $D$, explain why your results make sense.

**Exercise 3.** A weak base, B, has a p*k~b~* of 5 and an equilibrium partition constant, $K_D$, of 5 between an aqueous phase and an organic phase. What is the greatest extraction efficiency you can achieve using a single 25.0-mL portion of the weak base and a single 25.0-mL portion of the organic phase? Suppose you want to minimize the extraction of B, what limitation can you place on the sample's pH such that less than 1% of B is extracted into the organic phase. Assume equal volumes of the weak acid and the organic phase.
