Our treatment of liquid-liquid extractions is easy to extend to other systems, such as the two schemes illustrated on the right: the extraction of $\ce{I2}$ in the presence of iodide, $\ce{I-}$, and the extraction of the metal-ligand complex, $\ce{ML2}$. 

#### Qualitative Evaluation of Extraction Efficiency

Understanding how to control extraction efficiency is a straight-forward application of LeCh√¢telier's Principle. For example, in the extraction of $\ce{I2}$, decreasing the concentration of $\ce{I-}$ pushes the equilibrium reaction between $\ce{I2}$ and $\ce{I3-}$ to the left, which increases the concentration of $\ce{I2}$ in the aqueous phase; in turn, this pushes the equilibrium reaction between $(\ce{I2})_{aq}$ and $(\ce{I2})_{org}$ toward the organic phase, increasing the extraction efficiency.

#### Deriving Equations for $D$ and for $(Q_{aq})_n$

For a simple LLE the only equilibrium reaction is that between the solute in the aqueous phase and the solute in the organic phase 
$$S_{aq} \rightleftharpoons S_{org}$$
If the solute begins in the aqueous phase, then a conservation of mass requires that the moles of $S$ in the aqueous phase before the extraction is equal to the moles of $S$ in both phases after the extraction
$$(\text{mol S}_{aq})_0 = (\text{mol S}_{aq})_1 + (\text{mol S}_{org})_1$$
where the subscripts 0 and 1 are, respectively, before and after the first extraction. Solving for $(\text{mol S}_{org})_1$, substituting into the equation for $D$ and rearranging gives
$$D = \frac{[S_{org}]}{[S_{aq}]} = \frac{\frac{(\text{mol S}_{aq})_0 - (\text{mol S}_{aq})_1}{V_{org}}}{\frac{(\text{mol S}_{aq})_1}{V_{aq}}} = \frac{(\text{mol S}_{aq})_0 \times V_{aq} - (\text{mol S}_{aq})_1 \times V_{aq}}{(\text{mol S}_{aq})_1 \times V_{org}}$$
which rearranges to give
$$q_{aq} = \frac{(\text{mol S}_{aq})_1}{(\text{mol S}_{aq})_0} = \frac{V_{aq}}{D V_{org} + V_{aq}}$$
where $q_{aq}$ is the fraction of solute that remains in the aqueous phase after the extraction. For *n* identical extractions, the fraction that remains in the aqueous phase, $(Q_{aq})_n$, is
$$(Q_{aq})_n = (q_{aq})^n = \left( \frac{V_{aq}}{D V_{org} + V_{aq}} \right)^n$$

For any extraction in which we must account for other, secondary, equilibrium reactions, we need only determine how $D$ depends on the secondary equilibrium constants. For example, in the extraction of $\text{ML}_2$, we have, using the scheme on the lower right
$$K_D = \frac{[\text{ML}_2]_{org}}{[\text{ML}_2]_{aq}} \quad \quad \beta_2 = \frac{[\text{ML}_2]_{aq}}{[\text{M}^{2+}]_{aq}[\text{L}^-]_{aq}^2} \quad \quad D = \frac{[\text{ML}_{2}]_{org}}{[\text{ML}_2]_{aq} + [\text{M}^{2+}]_{aq}}$$
Solving $\beta_2$ for $[\text{M}^{2+}]_{aq}$ and substituting into the equation for the distribution ratio gives, after some rearranging
$$D = \frac {K_D \beta_2 [\text{L}^-]_{aq}^2} {1 + \beta_2 [\text{L}^-]_{aq}^2}$$
